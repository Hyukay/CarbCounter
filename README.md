# AI-Powered Carb Counting for Diabetic Patients

An AI-assisted application designed to help diabetic patients accurately count carbohydrates in their meals using advanced food image recognition and machine learning techniques. By taking a simple picture of a meal, the application identifies the food items, estimates portion sizes, and calculates nutritional values, such as carbohydrate content, with precision. This tool aims to simplify the challenging task of carb counting, which is crucial for diabetes management, and reduce the manual effort required by patients.

## Features
- **Food Image Recognition:**
  - Identify food items in meal images using fine-tuned pre-trained models such as ConvNeXt, MobileNetV2, or ResNet.
  - Leverage the Nutrition5k dataset for accurate classification and prediction.
- **Carbohydrate Estimation:**
  - Predict the carbohydrate content in grams using regression models trained on annotated food images.
  - Ensure precision to meet the strict dietary requirements of diabetic patients.
- **User Feedback Loop:**
  - Allow users to provide additional context for ambiguous cases (e.g., sauces, toppings) to refine predictions.
  - Incorporate feedback to improve model accuracy over time.
- **Expandable Design:**
  - Designed to extend functionality to estimate other macronutrients, such as protein and fat.
- **Customizable:**
  - Adaptable for regional cuisines and personalized nutrition tracking through dataset fine-tuning.
